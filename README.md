The concept of Cleveland Live Music, or CLM, is a resource of Live Musical performances in Northeast Ohio. Users of CLM are able to locate LIve Music any date they select. The motivation to create CLM was to provide live music enthusiasts a resource to quickly locate Live Musical performances in their area. The goal was to create an easy to use application through the use of a mobile device or computer.


Examples of possibe user's stories include:

Roland Rocker a band member that follows other bands and music festivals in Northeast Ohio. He is able to quickly view dates of band performances and music festivals through CLM and find locations using maps through the use of the Mapbox GL JS.

Rocky is a Hall of Fame fan and is visiting the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, in Cleveland, Ohio. After a tour of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame he would like to see a live rock concert today. He can easily view live musical performances appearing tonight through the calendar in the CLM app that uses Datepicker jQuery UI.

Renetta is a resident of Cleveland and is looking for Live entertainment this weekend. She refers to the CLM app to determine live music performances in and around Cleveland this weekend.

And, Ralph is traveling for business and would like to see live music with coworkers. He uses the CLM app to coordinate an evening of live music for his coworkers to enjoy. The CLM app pulls all the performances in Northeast Ohio using an API call of data from Songkick.


The design process of CLM originated by creating a wireframe of the web page layout through the use of the program Balsamiq. Our group members communicated through Slack and Trello Boards. The initial idea was to create a web page containing:
- Header/Title panel with name at the top.
- Calendar for date selection.
- Table of Perfomers would be populated after a date is selected 
- Map of venue location would appear in Table next to the musical acts.
- Linked to Facebook when the musical performers image was clicked.

Each team member vounteered to complete a different element of the CLM project. Rhonda obtained a key for the APIs, Songkick and Bandsintown. Jason found Mapbox GL JS library to use instead of Google Maps. This was a more suitable alternative because Google Maps requires a substanial financial committment. Macauley discovered Bootstrap Datepicker to create a functioning calendar. Also, Macauley designed the Ohio CLM logo to be used in the header. Stacie created the CSS file and the HTML index file containing Bootstrap for the data table. Also, she was able to find a photo of the Cleveland skyline.

The technologies used to complete the CLM application are CSS, Bootstrap, Bootstrap Datepicker, Javascript jQuery, JSON, jQuery Modal, AJAX, Moment and Mapbox GL JS. Songkick and Bandsinstown are the APIs used in the CLM application.

The obstacles to complete the CLM application included GitHub, Javascript, Bootstrap Datepicker, Mapbox GL JS library and group collaboration. The APIs were a challenge to determine the query URLs and replacing special characters and strings. Organizing the order of the links and scripts in the HTML header was also difficult. The use of Mapbox, instead of Google Maps, was another handicap. Writing the code to display the maps and setting the maximum amount of maps to display were additional challenges to complete the CLM application.

Possible future developments for the CLM application are:
- An audio music sample of each artist or band when selected.
- Using Firebase to return data of user favorites.
- Providing additional information or links to purchase event tickets and artist or band merchandise.
- Display past events through the calendar to aid in the planning and organizing of future events.

The process to produce the CLM application proved to be a challenge at times. However, we were able to overcome the obstacles and create a successful dynamic website. CLM is a valueable resource for numerous Live Music fans throughout Northeast Ohio.
